# TS_AS_FILENAME: This can help eliminate duplicate images during sorting.
# TRUE: File will be renamed to the Unix timestamp and its extension.
# FALSE (any non-TRUE value): Filename is unchanged.

export TS_AS_FILENAME=TRUE
#
# USE_LMDATE: If this is TRUE, images without EXIF data will have their Last Modified file
# timestamp used as a fallback. If FALSE, images without EXIF data are put in noexif/ for
# manual sorting.
# Valid options are "TRUE" or anything else (assumes FALSE). FIXME: Restrict to TRUE/FALSE
#
export USE_LMDATE=TRUE
#
# USE_FILE_EXT: The following option is here as a compatibility option as well as a bugfix.
# If this is set to TRUE, files are identified using FILE's magic, and the extension
# is set accordingly. If FALSE (or any other value), file extension is left as-is.
# CAUTION: If set to TRUE, extensions may be changed to values you do not expect.
# See the manual page for file(1) to understand how this works. Jeff says on my system
#invalid file extensions are ignored and this only checks capitalisation
#
export USE_FILE_EXT=TRUE
#
# JPEG_TO_JPG: The following option is here for personal preference. If TRUE, this will
# cause .jpg to be used instead of .jpeg as the file extension. If FALSE (or any other
# value) .jpeg is used instead.
#
export JPEG_TO_JPG=TRUE
#
#
# The following is an array of filetypes that we intend to locate using find.
# Any imagemagick-supported filetype can be used, but EXIF data is only present in
# jpeg and tiff. Script will optionally use the last-modified time for sorting (see above)
# Extensions are matched case-insensitive. *.jpg is treated the same as *.JPG, etc.
# Can handle any file type; not just EXIF-enabled file types. See USE_LMDATE above.
#
FILETYPES=("*.jpg" "*.jpeg" "*.png" "*.tif" "*.tiff" "*.gif" "*.xcf")

# Optional: Prefix of new top-level directory to move sorted photos to.
# Can be a relative pathspec, but an # absolute pathspec is recommended.
